## 💪🏼 Features

Some of the features the patches provide are:

* 🌦️ **Weather-Based Heating**: Automatically adjusting heating in real-time based on current weather conditions, ensuring optimal comfort
* 🧠 **Neural Network Integration**: Neural network algorithms power the intelligent decision-making process for precise temperature control
* 👤 **User-Friendly Interface**: An interface that makes it easy for homeowners to interact with and customize their heating preferences
* 🌿 **Energy Efficiency**: Prioritizing energy efficiency, helping you save on heating costs while maintaining a comfortable environment
* ✨ **And much more!**

## 🚀 Installation

SweatControl requires Python >= 3.10 on the machine in order to run. 
First, clone the project with either HTTPS or SSH:

- SSH:
`git clone git@github.com:AEYCEN/sweatControl.git`
- HTTPS:
`git clone https://github.com/AEYCEN/sweatControl.git`

Then, create an environment to run the application. First, navigate in the `sweatControl` folder and run the following command:

- Linux:
`python3 -m venv .venv`
- Windows:
`py -3 -m venv .venv`

After creating the environment, activate it with the following command:

- Linux:
`. .venv/bin/activate`
- Windows:
`.venv\Scripts\activate`

After that, install flask:
`pip install Flask`

(If you want to end the running environment, just enter `deactivate` inside the venv root directory)

Finally, install all the required plugins:
`pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn requests`
## 🛠️ Usage

To run SweatControl, use the flask command or python -m flask. You need to tell the Flask where your application is with the --app option.
This starts the file "app.py":

`flask --app app run`

Now head over to [localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/), and you should see the running application.

If another program is already using port 5000, you’ll see OSError: [Errno 98] or OSError: [WinError 10013] when the server tries to start. See [Address already in use](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/server/#address-already-in-use) for how to handle that.
