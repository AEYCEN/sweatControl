## üí™üèº Features

Some of the features the patches provide are:

* üå¶Ô∏è **Weather-Based Heating**: Automatically adjusting heating in real-time based on current weather conditions, ensuring optimal comfort
* üß† **Neural Network Integration**: Neural network algorithms power the intelligent decision-making process for precise temperature control
* üë§ **User-Friendly Interface**: An interface that makes it easy for homeowners to interact with and customize their heating preferences
* üåø **Energy Efficiency**: Prioritizing energy efficiency, helping you save on heating costs while maintaining a comfortable environment
* ‚ú® **And more!**

## üöÄ Installation

### Environment & Plugins

SweatControl does require Python >= 3.10 on the machine in order to run.
First, create and activate a Python environment to run the application. Navigate in the newly cloned `sweatControl` folder and run the following 2 commands:

üêß *Linux:*

    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate

ü™ü *Windows:*

    py -3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate

Then install all the required plugins:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to stop the running environment after using the application, just type `deactivate` while the CLI will display `(.venv)` in front of your user input.

### OpenWeather API key

An [OpenWeather 2.5 API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) is required to run the application. 
Create a file `open_weather.py` with the following template and insert your API key:

    API_KEY = "<YourApiKey>"

Finally, create in the root directory a folder with the name `secret` and put the created file `open_weather.py` in it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Always activate the environment (*like described above in the second line of the os related part*) before you run SweatControl with the following command:

    python run.py

To run it in debug mode instead, use:

    flask --app app run --debug

Head over to [localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/), and you should see the running application.

If another program is already using port 5000, you‚Äôll see OSError: [Errno 98] or OSError: [WinError 10013] when the server tries to start. See [Address already in use](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/server/#address-already-in-use) for how to handle that.
